\section{Introduction}

\section{Evaluation Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item{ Two evaluators, called the evaluator, who will read instructions and interact with the user, and the recorder, who will observe and fill out evaluation reports }
\item{ A jailbroken iPhone with our HCIPlayer application installed }
\item{ A quiet setting with a fast and reliable WIFI connection }
\item{ A copy of the user manual }
\end{itemize}

\section{Device Summary}
The HCIPlayer is an iPhone with the HCIPlayer application installed. It is a portable music player that takes speech and gestures for input while providing synthesized speech and vibration for basic feedback. Evaluators may find it useful to know that the iPhone itself does not process speech itself, but rather it exchanges data with a remote server, acting only as a microphone in the speech recognition pipeline. Therefore, a fast and reliable WIFI connection must be available to the HCIPlayer during operation. Gesture recognition is handled on the device and any visual feedback provided is for debugging purposes only. 

\section{Testing Process}
It is essential that the evaluators first familiarize themselves with the device by reading the user manual. As a pair, perform the setup procedure as prescribed by the user manual and test out a number of voice commands and finger gestures. Upon meeting with the user, the evaluator will read the user manual introduction to the user and administer the pretest questionnaire.
