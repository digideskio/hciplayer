\section{Introduction}

This document provides the necessary information to conduct usability testing and evaluation of the high-fidelity HCIPlayer prototype. Before you begin, please ensure that you have all of the items listed below.

\begin{itemize}
\item Two examiners: the instructor, who will read instructions and interact with the user; and the evaluator, who will observe and fill out evaluation reports
\item The HCIPlayer prototype (a jailbroken iPhone with the HCIPlayer application installed)
\item A quiet environment with a fast and reliable WIFI connection
\item The \href{http://fluidsurveys.com/s/hciplayer-datacollectionsheet/}{data collection sheet} (online, requires an internet connection to use)
\item The \href{http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~scormi3/hci/docs/user-manual.pdf}{user manual}
\item The \href{http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~scormi3/hci/docs/pretest-questionnaire.pdf}{pre-test questionnaire}
\item The \href{http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~scormi3/hci/docs/posttest-questionnaire.pdf}{post-test questionnaire}
\end{itemize}

During testing, if the user needs help or is stuck on a task, only information from the User Manual should be provided.

\section{Device Summary}

The HCIPlayer is an iPhone with the HCIPlayer application installed. It is a portable music player that takes speech and gestures for input while providing synthesized speech and vibration for basic feedback. Evaluators may find it useful to know that the iPhone itself does not process speech itself, but rather it exchanges data with a remote server, acting only as a microphone in the speech recognition pipeline. Therefore, a fast and reliable WIFI connection must be available to the HCIPlayer during operation. Gesture recognition is handled on the device and any visual feedback provided is for debugging purposes only. 

\section{Test Procedure}

\subsection{Experiment Setup}

\begin{enumerate}
\item It is essential that the examiners first familiarize themselves with the device by reading the user manual.
\item The examiners should test out a number of voice commands and gestures to ensure both that they are familiar with the system and that the system is installed and working correctly.
\item The instructor should read the User Briefing to the user (found at the end of this document).
\item The evaluator should administer the pre-test questionnaire.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Test Script}

For each benchmark task, the instructor should read the appropriate instructions below to the user, and the evaluator should fill out the data collection sheet with the necessary information.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Play the first song in your music library by tapping the screen.
\item Pause the song by tapping a second time.
\item Play the next song in your music library by swiping to the right.
\item Go back to the first song by swiping to the left.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Conclusion}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The evaluator should administer the post-test questionnaire.
\end{enumerate}
