\section{Introduction}
This document outlines the tasks that we expect a user to be able to perform with the HCIPlayer device as well as defining useful metrics for the usability of the device based on the user's performance in these tasks. We also formulate reasonable performance expectations for these tasks.

\section{Usability Goals}

Our usability goals are as follows (more detail can be found in the project notebook):

\begin{description}
\item[Ease-of-Use (EU)] \hfill \\
The ease-of-use measure is based on how easily the user is able to perform commands to which he/she has been introduced. This usability goal is measured in the number of seconds it takes for the user to correctly complete a command.
\item[Effectiveness of Gesture Recognition (GR)] \hfill \\
This goal attempts to quantify how well gestures are recognized, and is measured in the number of gestures a user makes before the command is successfully recognized.
\item[Effectiveness of Voice Recognition (VR)] \hfill \\
This goal attempts to quantify how well voice commands are recognized, and is measured in the number of times the user says a command before it is successfully recognized.
\end{description}
